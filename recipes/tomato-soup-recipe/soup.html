        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried basil</li>

      <p>Instructions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced
          onion and minced garlic, saut√©ing until the onion becomes translucent
          and fragrant.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour in the canned diced tomatoes, including their juice, and the
          vegetable or chicken broth.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir in the sugar, dried basil, and dried oregano, then bring the
          mixture to a gentle simmer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Allow the soup to simmer for about 15 minutes, allowing the flavors to
          meld together.
        </li>
        <li>
          If desired, use an immersion blender or transfer the soup to a blender
          to puree until smooth. Be cautious when blending hot liquids to avoid
          splattering.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir in the heavy cream (if using) to add creaminess to the soup.
        </li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Serve hot, garnishing with fresh basil leaves if desired.</li>
