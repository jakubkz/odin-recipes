      <h3>The recipe:</h3>
      <p>Ingredients:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>12 oz (340g) spaghetti or linguine</li>
        <li>1/2 cup guanciale or pancetta, diced</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>3/4 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Optional: chopped parsley for garnish</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Instructions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Cook the pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water until al dente.
          Reserve about 1/2 cup of pasta water before draining.
        </li>
        <li>
          While the pasta cooks, saut√© the diced guanciale or pancetta in a
          separate pan over medium heat until it turns crispy and golden.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, grated Pecorino Romano cheese, and
          a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the pasta is cooked, immediately add it to the pan with the
          crispy guanciale or pancetta. Toss to coat the pasta with the rendered
          fat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove the pan from the heat, and quickly pour the egg and cheese
          mixture over the pasta, tossing vigorously to create a creamy sauce.
          The heat from the pasta will cook the eggs, creating a smooth texture.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the sauce seems too thick, gradually add some of the reserved pasta
          water until it reaches your desired consistency.
        </li>
        <li>
          Season with salt if needed (remember that the guanciale or pancetta
          and cheese are already salty).
        </li>
        <li>
          Optionally, garnish with chopped parsley for a pop of color and
          freshness.
        </li>
        <li>
          Serve immediately, and enjoy your delicious homemade Carbonara pasta!
