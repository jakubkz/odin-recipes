        <li>1 lb ground beef (80% lean)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>4 slices of cheese (cheddar, American, or Swiss)</li>
        <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
        <li>Lettuce leaves</li>
        <li>Sliced tomatoes</li>
        <li>Sliced pickles</li>
        <li>Ketchup and mustard (optional)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Instructions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat a grill or a skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>
          Divide the ground beef into four equal portions and shape them into
          patties. Season both sides with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cook the burger patties on the preheated grill or skillet for about
          4-5 minutes per side, or until they reach your desired level of
          doneness.
        </li>
        <li>
          During the last minute of cooking, place a slice of cheese on top of
          each patty to let it melt slightly.
        </li>
        <li>
          While the patties are cooking, lightly toast the hamburger buns on the
          grill or in a toaster.
        </li>
        <li>
          Assemble the cheeseburgers by placing a cooked patty on the bottom
          half of each bun.
        </li>
        <li>
          Top the patties with lettuce leaves, sliced tomatoes, and pickles.
        </li>
        <li>
          Optionally, add ketchup and mustard on the top half of the buns.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place the top half of the bun over the toppings to complete the
          cheeseburgers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Serve immediately and enjoy your delicious homemade cheeseburgers!
